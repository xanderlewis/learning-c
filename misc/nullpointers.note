'The C standard does not say that the null pointer is the same as the pointer to memory address 0, though that may be the case in practice. most operating systems map the null pointer's address such that accessing it causes a segmentation fault. this behaviour is not guaranteed by the C standard. dereferencing a null pointer is undefined behaviour in C, and a conforming implementation is allowed to assume that any pointer that is dereferenced is not null.'
