Just a note on the hello world program I just wrote in C.

In K&R, the main function didn't have a type.

Well, I tried doing it that way and it compiled -- but with a warning.

Apparently it defaults to int.

Interestingly, even if you don't actually return anything it still compiles without a complaint.

Of course, I could choose to return 0 or something.. I guess.. but the book hasn't talked about that yet.
