Let's write some lines to test my wc clone.
Of course, it doesn't take any options (or even arguments).
But it reads from stdin and outputs the number of lines, words and characters.
Let's put this file in and compare the output to what wc (in its default state) gives.
Try some tabs as well: tabs	are	fun	aren't	they.
