Another note on the hello world program... well, about the printf library function incldued in stdio.h.

If I remember correctly, its type is something like int (char *str ...) or something.

So it has return type int (I guess it returns an exit code or something?) and it takes an argument called str that is of type pointer to a char.

That makes sense to me, because a string in C is just an array of chars, which itself is just like a pointer to a char with some continguous memory addresses allocated for further chars in the string. So str is just a memory address; the address where the first char in the string we want to print is stored. Printf then looks along these addresses to read all of it? I have no idea really how this works yet.

Anyway, I'll keep reading...
